# Technical Debt

We have made a lot of incremental changes. Review the project for technical debt or better ways to implement complex features, and create a plan to resolve this.

With my approval, fix the debt stage by stage. At the end of each stage test the software and when we've agreed this is complete, commit the changes.

Think very deeply.
