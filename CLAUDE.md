# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Free Flight Log is a cross-platform application for logging paraglider, hang glider, and microlight flights. This repository contains:

- **Complete Flutter Application**: Fully functional MVP with flight logging capabilities
- **Planning Documents**: Original functional specification, technical design, and MVP build plan
- **Legacy Design Assets**: An old app design from December 2022 created in Appery.io (a visual app builder)
- **Working Implementation**: Flutter app with database, UI screens, and core functionality

## Project Status

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - The MVP has been successfully built and is functional:

âœ… **Completed Features:**
- Flight logging with comprehensive form validation
- SQLite database with full CRUD operations
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Android, iOS, macOS, Windows)
- Material Design 3 UI with proper theming
- Flight list with statistics display
- Repository pattern architecture implementation
- Database initialization for all platforms
- IGC file import with flight track visualization
- Climb rate calculations (instantaneous and 15-second averaged)
- Flight detail screens with comprehensive statistics
- OpenStreetMap integration for cross-platform track display
- Folder memory for IGC import workflow
- Timezone support for IGC imports with proper time display
- Track distance column in flight list for comprehensive flight analysis
- Midnight crossing flight duration handling

ðŸ“‹ **Planning Documents** (for reference):
- Complete functional requirements (FUNCTIONAL_SPECIFICATION.md)
- Technical architecture using Flutter/Dart (TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)
- Week-by-week MVP implementation plan (MVP_BUILD_PLAN.md)

## Quick Development Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the Flutter app
cd free_flight_log_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Linux desktop (recommended for development)
flutter run -d linux

# Run on Android (device must be connected)
flutter run -d android
```

For comprehensive development setup, build commands, testing, and troubleshooting, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Architecture Overview

**Current Implementation:**
- **Pattern**: MVVM with Repository pattern âœ…
- **State Management**: Provider (ready for implementation) 
- **Database**: SQLite via sqflite (mobile) + sqflite_common_ffi (desktop) âœ…
- **UI Framework**: Flutter with Material Design 3 âœ…

For detailed technical architecture, database schema, and implementation details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development Status

### âœ… MVP Features (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… Manual flight entry form with validation
2. âœ… Flight list display with statistics
3. âœ… Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
4. âœ… Simple statistics (total flights/hours/max altitude)
5. âœ… Local SQLite persistence with cross-platform support
6. âœ… IGC file import and parsing with climb rate calculations
7. âœ… OpenStreetMap integration for cross-platform track visualization
8. âœ… Flight detail view with inline editing capability and comprehensive statistics
9. âœ… Wing/equipment management with automatic creation from IGC data
10. âœ… Database migrations for schema updates

### ðŸš€ Next Features (Post-MVP)
1. ðŸ“‹ Altitude and climb rate charts (fl_chart ready)
2. ðŸ“‹ Site recognition via reverse geocoding
3. ðŸ“‹ Export functionality (CSV, KML)
4. ðŸ“‹ Provider state management implementation
5. ðŸ“‹ Advanced flight analysis and statistics
6. ðŸ“‹ Flight comparison and trend analysis

## Important Notes

- This is a **local-only** app - no cloud services or user authentication
- All data stored on device in SQLite database
- Cross-platform support: Linux âœ…, Android âœ…, iOS âœ…, macOS âœ…, Windows âœ…
- Material Design 3 UI with proper theming
- Full IGC import and flight track visualization capability
- Comprehensive climb rate analysis with 15-second averaging
- Database migration support for schema updates
- Remembers last IGC import folder for improved workflow
- Timezone-aware time display for international flight logging
- Automatic midnight crossing duration correction
- Track distance analysis with sortable flight list columns
