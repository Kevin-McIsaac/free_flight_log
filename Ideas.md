# Ideas

1. We have two ways to get more information on the airspace at a point,
   1. hover: show a simple tooltip and highlight the lowest airspace (what do we call that)
   2. click: show the airspace info widget that lists the entire stack of airspaces.

This "is messy and the UI does not work well on mobile. Provide better options for exploring the airspace layers at a point


Do we apply FIltering before cliping to optimise performance?
