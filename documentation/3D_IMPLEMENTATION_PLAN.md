# 3D Flight Tracker Implementation Plan

## PHASE 1: BASIC TERRAIN + FLIGHT TRACK (Week 1) ðŸŽ¯

### Phase 1A: Minimal Cesium Integration (Days 1-2)
**Goal: Empty Cesium scene running on Pixel 9**

#### Tasks:
- [x] Create basic Cesium WebView widget
- [ ] Test empty Cesium scene on Pixel 9

#### Files to Create:
- `lib/presentation/widgets/flight_track_3d_widget.dart`

#### Dependencies to Add:
```yaml
dependencies:
  webview_flutter: ^4.4.0
```

#### Test Integration:
- Add 3D View button to FlightDetailScreen
- Expected Result: Empty Cesium globe loads without crashing

### Phase 1B: Basic Terrain + Flight Track (Days 3-4)
**Goal: Real terrain + IGC flight track rendering**

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add terrain rendering with basic flight track
- [ ] Test terrain + track on Pixel 9

#### Features:
- World terrain integration
- Yellow flight track polyline
- Launch/landing markers
- Camera auto-fit to track

### Phase 1C: Integration (Day 5)
**Goal: Seamless integration with existing UI**

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate with existing FlightTrackWidget
- [ ] Test full integration on Pixel 9

#### Features:
- 2D/3D mode switcher
- Consistent UI integration
- Performance optimization

## PHASE 2: FLY-THROUGH ANIMATION (Week 2)

### Phase 2A: Camera Follow Animation (Days 6-7)
- [ ] Implement smooth camera follow animation
- [ ] Test fly-through on Pixel 9

### Phase 2B: Playback Controls (Days 8-9)
- [ ] Add playback controls and speed adjustment
- [ ] Test controls responsiveness on Pixel 9

### Phase 2C: Visual Enhancements (Day 10)
- [ ] Add altitude-based track coloring
- [ ] Final testing and optimization for Pixel 9

## PHASE 3: POLISH & OPTIMIZATION (Week 3)
- Performance tuning for Android mid-range devices
- Offline terrain caching
- Battery optimization
- Touch gesture refinements

## CRITICAL TESTING CHECKPOINTS ðŸ§ª

### Checkpoint 1 (Day 2): Basic Scene
- **Test**: Does Cesium load without crashing on Pixel 9?
- **Expected**: Empty 3D globe with terrain
- **Command**: `flutter run -d pixel --dart-define=flutter.flutter_map.unblockOSM="Our tile servers are not."`

### Checkpoint 2 (Day 4): Terrain + Track
- **Test**: Is flight track visible in 3D space?
- **Expected**: Yellow track with launch/landing markers
- **Check**: Smooth camera movement on touch

### Checkpoint 3 (Day 5): Integration
- **Test**: Seamless 2D/3D mode switching
- **Expected**: No memory leaks, <200MB usage

### Checkpoint 4 (Day 7): Animation
- **Test**: Smooth fly-through animation
- **Expected**: >30fps performance, no stuttering

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

1. âœ… Add webview_flutter dependency to pubspec.yaml
2. âœ… Create FlightTrack3DWidget with basic Cesium scene
3. âœ… Add test button to FlightDetailScreen
4. ðŸŽ¯ **TEST ON PIXEL 9 IMMEDIATELY**

## QUESTIONS FOR EACH CHECKPOINT

1. "Does it load without crashing on Pixel 9?"
2. "Is the performance acceptable (>30fps)?"
3. "Are there any WebView errors in console?"
4. "Does it need adjustment before proceeding?"

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **Week 1**: Working 3D terrain + flight track
- **Week 2**: Smooth fly-through animation
- **Week 3**: Production-ready performance

This plan delivers **basic 3D visualization within 4 days** with continuous Pixel 9 validation.
