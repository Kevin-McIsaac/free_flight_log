# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Main Thread Blocking (Critical)
**Symptoms:**
- "Skipped 106 frames! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread"
- "Davey! duration=1865ms" warnings
- UI freezing during initialization

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Removed unnecessary `addPostFrameCallback` delay for WebView initialization
- ✅ Made connectivity check asynchronous using `Future.microtask`
- ✅ Delayed memory monitoring start to avoid initialization overhead
- ✅ WebView now initializes immediately instead of waiting for frame completion

### 2. Excessive Console Logging
**Symptoms:**
- Hundreds of debug log lines cluttering output
- Performance overhead from constant logging

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Reduced console message logging to errors only in release mode
- ✅ Filtered out repetitive messages (Tiles queued, Memory reports)
- ✅ Changed memory monitoring interval from 10s to 30s
- ✅ Changed JavaScript cleanup interval from 30s to 60s

### 3. Database Performance
**Symptoms:**
- SQLite warning: "double-quoted string literal: "%Y""
- Potential query inefficiency

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Fixed SQL index creation to use single quotes for strftime function
- ✅ Changed from `strftime("%Y", date)` to `strftime('%Y', date)`

### 4. Memory Management Improvements
**Symptoms:**
- Aggressive tile cache resets potentially causing re-downloads

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Increased tile cache threshold from 15 to 35 before trimming
- ✅ Changed from `reset()` to `trim()` for more gentle cleanup
- ✅ Removed primitive cleanup as it could interfere with Cesium operations

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations:
- App initialization: ~3s with multiple frame drops
- Memory monitoring: Every 10 seconds
- Console logging: All messages logged
- Tile cache: Reset at 15 tiles

### After Optimizations:
- App initialization: Immediate WebView load, no frame delay
- Memory monitoring: Every 30 seconds (reduced overhead)
- Console logging: Errors only in release, filtered in debug
- Tile cache: Trim at 35 tiles (better caching)

## Expected Improvements:
1. **Faster initial load** - No artificial delays
2. **Smoother UI** - Reduced main thread blocking
3. **Less CPU usage** - Reduced logging and monitoring frequency
4. **Better memory efficiency** - Smarter cache management
5. **Cleaner logs** - Only important messages shown

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Monitor frame rate during app startup
2. Check memory usage remains stable (~33-40MB)
3. Verify 3D map loads without delays
4. Ensure no SQLite warnings in logs
5. Test on both debug and release builds
