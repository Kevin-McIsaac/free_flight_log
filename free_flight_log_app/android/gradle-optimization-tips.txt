# Additional tips to speed up Gradle builds:
# 1. Use gradle-profiler to identify bottlenecks:
#    ./gradlew assembleDebug --profile
#
# 2. Clear build cache if builds are inconsistent:
#    cd android && ./gradlew clean && ./gradlew cleanBuildCache
#
# 3. For repeated builds, use:
#    flutter build apk --debug --no-tree-shake-icons
#
# 4. Consider using AAB for release builds (smaller):
#    flutter build appbundle
#
# 5. Exclude unnecessary resources in debug builds
