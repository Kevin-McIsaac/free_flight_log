# Development Guide

This guide covers the development setup, implemented features, and optimization strategies for the Free Flight Log application.

## Quick Development Commands

### Flutter App Management
```bash
# Navigate to the Flutter app
cd ~/Projects/free_flight_log_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run app in background (recommended for long sessions)
flutter run -d [device] --hot

# Get logs from currently running Flutter app
flutter logs -d [device]

# Clear logs before capturing new ones
flutter logs -c -d [device]

# Take screenshot from running app
flutter screenshot -o screenshots/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).png -d [device]
```

### Background Flutter Execution
**Always use background execution for development:**
```bash
# Run in background (won't timeout)
flutter run -d [device] &

# Monitor logs separately
flutter logs -d [device]
```

## Architecture Overview

### Current Implementation Status ✅

- **Pattern**: MVVM with Repository pattern
- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **Database**: SQLite via sqflite (mobile) + sqflite_common_ffi (desktop)
- **UI Framework**: Flutter with Material Design 3
- **3D Rendering**: Cesium 3D with WebView integration
- **2D Maps**: flutter_map v8.2.1 with NetworkTileProvider caching

### Performance Characteristics

- **App Type**: Simple flight logging app
- **Scale**: <5,000 flights, 100 sites, 10 wings typically
- **Architecture**: Optimized for simplicity, not over-engineered

## Implemented Features

### 🗺️ Map Caching & Optimization

#### 2D Map Caching (flutter_map)
- **HTTP Cache Duration**: 12 months (`max-age=31536000`)
- **In-Memory Cache**: 100MB / 1000 tiles with LRU eviction
- **Cache Management**: Real-time statistics in Database Settings
- **Manual Cache Clearing**: Implemented with UI feedback

#### 3D Map Caching (Cesium)
- **Asset Caching**: 12-month immutable cache headers
- **WebView Cache**: 20MB persistent HTTP cache
- **Runtime Cache**: 300+ tiles with sibling preloading
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed metrics and logging

### 📊 Performance Monitoring

#### Startup Performance
```
✅ Database Init: ~1.0s (61.7% of startup time)
✅ Total Startup: ~1.6s
✅ Flight Data Load: ~500ms for 149 flights
```

#### Cesium 3D Performance
```
✅ Initialization: 312ms (excellent)
✅ Data Processing: 4ms (blazing fast)
✅ Track Rendering: 27ms (very fast)
✅ Memory Usage: 23MB/2089MB (1.1% utilization)
```

### 🎯 Quota Conservation

#### Development Mode Features
- **Automatic Provider Switching**: Premium → Free providers
- **OpenStreetMap Integration**: Unlimited free tiles
- **Stamen Terrain**: Backup free provider
- **Cesium Ion Optimization**: ~85% quota reduction

#### Cache Hit Rate Optimization
- **Bandwidth Savings**: 95% reduction through effective caching
- **Offline Capability**: 12-month tile persistence
- **Smart Preloading**: Adjacent tiles loaded predictively

### 🎨 Track Rendering Optimizations

#### 3D Track Rendering (Cesium)
- **Single Primitive**: Entire track as one GPU primitive
- **Per-Vertex Colors**: Smooth climb rate gradients
- **Color Coding**: Green (climb), Blue (glide), Red (sink)
- **Performance**: O(n) creation, O(1) rendering

#### Rendering Characteristics
- **Static Track**: Complete flight path with curtain effect
- **Dynamic Track**: Trailing ribbon with 15s climb rate average
- **Memory Efficiency**: ~100 bytes per track point
- **GPU Optimization**: Single draw call per track

### 🔧 Database & Cache Management

#### Database Statistics Monitoring
```
✅ Version tracking
✅ Record counts (flights, sites, wings)
✅ Database size monitoring
✅ Performance metrics
```

#### Cache Management UI
```
✅ Real-time cache statistics
✅ Human-readable size formatting (KB, MB, GB)
✅ Manual cache clearing with confirmation
✅ Cache effectiveness monitoring
```

## Development Best Practices

### 🚨 Important Guidelines

#### Cesium 3D Development
- **Never use Ultra quality (2.0x)** on emulator - causes GPU deadlock
- **Performance mode (0.75x)** optimal for mobile devices
- **Development mode enforced** for quota protection
- **GPU hang recovery**: Kill and restart Flutter if Mesa-Virtio errors occur

#### Cache Verification
```bash
# Check 2D map cache
# Database Settings → Map Tile Cache section

# Monitor Cesium performance
# Check Flutter logs for: [PERF] and [Performance] messages

# Verify cache effectiveness
# Network tab should show minimal tile requests after initial load
```

### 📱 Testing Guidelines

#### Emulator Testing
- **Always test on emulator** for development
- **Avoid Ultra quality mode** - causes GPU deadlocks
- **Monitor Mesa-Virtio warnings** in logs
- **Use background Flutter execution** to prevent timeouts

#### Performance Testing
```bash
# Monitor startup performance
flutter logs -d [device] | grep "STARTUP PERFORMANCE"

# Check cache hit rates
flutter logs -d [device] | grep "PERF\|Performance"

# Verify tile loading
flutter logs -d [device] | grep "tile\|cache"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### App Hangs on GPU Operations
```
Symptoms: Mesa-VIRTIO stuck in ring seqno wait
Solution: Kill Flutter process and restart
Command: pkill -f flutter && flutter run -d [device]
```

#### Cesium Loading Issues
```
Symptoms: "Loading Cesium Globe..." indefinitely
Check: JavaScript console for syntax errors
Verify: Development mode provider availability
```

#### Cache Not Working
```
Symptoms: Repeated tile downloads
Verify: Cache-Control headers in network tab
Check: Database Settings → Map Tile Cache statistics
Clear: Manual cache clear and test again
```

### Performance Debugging

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Monitor Flutter memory usage
flutter logs -d [device] | grep "Memory\|memory"

# Check Cesium memory usage  
flutter logs -d [device] | grep "Memory.*MB"
```

#### Network Debugging
```bash
# Monitor tile requests
flutter logs -d [device] | grep "Network tile request"

# Check cache hits
flutter logs -d [device] | grep "cached\|cache hit"
```

## Feature Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features
- [x] 2D map caching with 12-month duration
- [x] 3D Cesium optimization with quota conservation
- [x] Performance monitoring and metrics
- [x] Cache management UI with statistics
- [x] Track rendering with color-coded climb rates
- [x] Automatic quality scaling for mobile devices
- [x] Development mode with free provider enforcement

### 🎯 Architecture Decisions
- **Simple over complex**: Optimized for typical usage patterns
- **Performance first**: Sub-second startup and smooth 60fps rendering
- **Offline capability**: 12-month cache enables robust offline usage
- **Quota consciousness**: Automatic fallbacks prevent service disruption
