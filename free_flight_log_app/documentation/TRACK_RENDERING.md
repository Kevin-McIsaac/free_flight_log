# Track Rendering Implementation

## Overview

The Free Flight Log application uses advanced Cesium 3D rendering to visualize flight tracks with color-coded climb rate information. Both static and dynamic tracks use a unified primitive-based rendering approach with per-vertex colors for smooth gradients. This was particularly difficult to animate

## Color Coding System

Tracks are coloured based on the 15-second trailing average climb rate:

- **Green**: Climb (≥0 m/s) - Indicates thermal lift or ascending flight
- **Blue**: Weak sink (-1.5 to 0 m/s) - Normal glide or weak sink
- **Red**: Strong sink (≤-1.5 m/s) - Strong sink or descending flight

### Overview
The static track displays the complete flight path with smooth 
color gradients based on climb rate at each point. Under
the track is a curtain effect (transparent wall) that helps show the distance form terrain.

Their is a  dynamic track looks like a trailing ribbon
coloured by climb rate with a curtain effect. The colouring of the 
dynamic track created additional  complexity that required exploring
 multiple different way to implement this. After many failures we
found the  simplest, most reliable was:

- **Single Primitive**: Entire track rendered as one primitive for optimal performance
- **Per-Vertex Colors**: Each point has its own color, creating smooth gradients
- **Synchronous Rendering**: Prevents visual artifacts during creation
- **GPU Optimized**: Primitive-based rendering is more efficient than entities

### Performance Characteristics
- **Static Track**: O(n) creation, O(1) rendering
- **Dynamic Track**: O(w) updates where w = window size
- **Memory**: ~100 bytes per track point
- **GPU**: Single draw call per track
