# Performance Issues Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

**Status: CRITICAL** - Application performance is unsuitable for production when both sites and airspace features are enabled simultaneously.

### Key Findings:
- **95% frame drops** (114/120 frames) with both features enabled
- **27.8 FPS** average (target: 60 FPS)
- Performance degradation is **multiplicative** not additive
- RepaintBoundary optimizations helped but are insufficient

### Production Readiness: ❌ NOT READY
- Individual features: Marginal performance
- Combined features: Catastrophic failure

## Performance Metrics Comparison

| Configuration | Frame Drops | FPS | Worst Frame | Status | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-----|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Baseline (Empty Map)** | 55.8% | 50.4 | 19.8ms | Poor | Base flutter_map performance issue |
| **57 Sites Only** | 46.7% | 51.2 | 19.5ms | Marginal | 11% improvement over baseline |
| **1295 Airspace Only** | 46.7% | 41.2 | 24.3ms | Marginal | Heavier processing load |
| **Both Enabled** | **95.0%** | **27.8** | **35.9ms** | **CRITICAL** | Multiplicative degradation |

### Performance After Optimizations:
- **RepaintBoundary**: 67% improvement in sustained panning (20.8% vs 55.8% drops)
- **Throttled Monitoring**: Reduced overhead successfully
- **Overall**: Improvements visible but insufficient for combined features

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Flutter_map Rendering Bottleneck
- **Issue**: Dart/Canvas-based rendering cannot maintain 60 FPS
- **Evidence**: 55.8% frame drops even on empty map
- **Location**: `nearby_sites_map_widget.dart:258`

### 2. Multiplicative Performance Degradation
- **Expected**: 46.7% + 46.7% ≈ 50-60% drops
- **Actual**: 95% drops
- **Cause**: Resource contention between features
  - Both compete for rendering pipeline
  - Memory pressure causes GC thrashing
  - Thread blocking during polygon operations

### 3. Heavy Airspace Processing
- **Processing Time**: 725-865ms (exceeds 500ms threshold)
- **Polygon Clipping**: 287-502ms during map interactions
- **Polygons Rendered**: 1293-1295 complex geometries
- **Location**: `airspace_geojson_service.dart`

### 4. Memory Management Issues
- **Airspace Operations**: +11.6MB memory delta
- **Combined Load**: Triggers aggressive garbage collection
- **Cache Performance**: Good (100% hit rate) but insufficient

## Critical Performance Issues

### Issue #1: Frame Rate Collapse
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Measurement**: 95% frame drops, 27.8 FPS
- **Impact**: Application unusable
- **Root Cause**: Rendering pipeline saturation

### Issue #2: Airspace Processing Bottleneck
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Measurement**: 725-865ms processing time
- **Impact**: UI thread blocking
- **Root Cause**: Complex polygon clipping operations

### Issue #3: Site Rendering Overhead
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Measurement**: 46.7% frame drops with 57 sites
- **Impact**: Poor user experience
- **Root Cause**: No viewport culling or LOD

### Issue #4: Widget Rebuild Storms
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Measurement**: 40+ rebuilds tracked
- **Impact**: Unnecessary computation
- **Root Cause**: State management inefficiencies

## Optimization Attempts

### ✅ Successful Optimizations:
1. **RepaintBoundary Implementation**
   - Wrapped FlutterMap widget
   - Result: 67% improvement in sustained performance
   - Location: `nearby_sites_map_widget.dart:1292`

2. **Performance Monitor Throttling**
   - Reduced monitoring to 200ms intervals
   - Result: Eliminated monitoring overhead
   - Location: `nearby_sites_map_widget.dart:260`

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Site markers: 60% cache hit rate
   - Airspace geometries: 100% memory cache hits
   - Result: Eliminated network/disk I/O

### ❌ Insufficient for Production:
- Individual feature performance remains marginal
- Combined features cause catastrophic failure
- Need architectural changes, not just optimizations

## Recommendations

### 🚨 Immediate Actions (Emergency)

1. **Feature Toggle Implementation**
   ```dart
   // Allow EITHER sites OR airspace, not both
   if (sitesEnabled && airspaceEnabled && siteCount > 20) {
     // Disable less critical feature
   }
   ```

2. **Zoom-Based Feature Selection**
   - Zoom > 10: Show sites, hide airspace
   - Zoom 7-10: Show major airspace only
   - Zoom < 7: Show airspace regions, hide sites

### 📋 Short-Term Optimizations (1-2 weeks)

1. **Level of Detail (LOD) System**
   - Simplify airspace polygons at low zoom
   - Use marker clustering for sites
   - Progressive polygon complexity

2. **Viewport Culling**
   - Only render visible features
   - Implement spatial indexing (QuadTree/R-tree)
   - Pre-filter before rendering

3. **Sequential Loading**
   - Load airspace first (if enabled)
   - Defer site loading until airspace rendered
   - Show progress indicators

### 🏗️ Long-Term Architecture Changes (1-2 months)

1. **Alternative Map Renderer**
   - Consider `google_maps_flutter` (native rendering)
   - Evaluate `mapbox_gl` (WebGL-based)
   - Native performance vs Dart/Canvas

2. **Background Processing**
   - Move polygon clipping to isolates
   - Async geometry simplification
   - Pre-compute for common zoom levels

3. **Spatial Data Structure**
   - Implement R-tree for efficient spatial queries
   - Tile-based data loading
   - Progressive disclosure patterns

## Technical Details

### Performance Bottlenecks Located:

| Component | File | Line | Issue |
|-----------|------|------|-------|
| Frame Monitoring | `nearby_sites_map_widget.dart` | 258 | Excessive frame jank logging |
| Polygon Clipping | `airspace_geojson_service.dart` | 1432-1545 | 287-502ms operations |
| Site Markers | `nearby_sites_map_widget.dart` | 771 | Cache misses trigger rebuilds |
| Widget Rebuilds | `performance_monitor.dart` | 64 | Rapid rebuild warnings |

### Memory Usage Patterns:
- Baseline: ~520MB
- With airspace: ~620MB (+100MB)
- With both features: ~640MB (+120MB)
- GC triggers above 630MB causing frame drops

### API Performance:
- Site API: 1.8-2.7s for 50 sites
- Acceptable but compounds rendering issues
- Consider pagination or progressive loading

---

## Conclusion

The current implementation cannot support both sites and airspace features simultaneously on typical Android devices. While RepaintBoundary optimizations provided improvements, they are insufficient to overcome the fundamental rendering limitations of flutter_map with complex geometries.

### Recommended Path Forward:
1. **Immediate**: Implement feature toggle to prevent simultaneous use
2. **Short-term**: Add LOD and viewport culling
3. **Long-term**: Evaluate native map alternatives

### Success Criteria for Production:
- Maximum 20% frame drops during interactions
- Minimum 50 FPS sustained performance
- Sub-500ms processing for any operation
- Memory usage stable under 650MB
